# example how to use the avrnetio class

## import the avrnetio class:
import avrnetio
## for debugging (set debug mark with pdb.set_trace() )
import pdb
## for sys.exit(1)
import sys
## for NTC calculations
import electronics

        netio.setRefEP(refVoltage)
    except StandardError:

        sys.exit(1)
    NTCvoltage = netio.getADCsAsVolts()[4]
    
    netio = None
    
    
    temperature = electronics.ntc()
    temperature.Uvcc = refVoltage
    
    # print response
    print "\n--------- successfully queried the AVR-NET-IO with ethersex commands ---------"

    print "---------------------------------------------------------------- \n"
