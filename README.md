# avrnetio: A Python class to interface the Pollin AVR-NET-IO via ECMD TCP/IP commands.

## Project Information

This software (avrnetio) provides an interface via TCP to control 
the Pollin AVR-NET-IO running the ethersex firmware <ethersex.de>.
The software consists of a class to represent the possibilities of 
the product and example code to show how to use it.

## Moving Forward

I hope that someone will join the team as I have no time yet to complete
the class. If you know Python and want to contribute, then please join the team!
