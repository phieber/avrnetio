# avrnetio  ... a free measurement framework for the ethersex platform written in Python.

## Project Information

This software (avrnetio) provides a comfortable way to communicate with any hardware
running the ethersex firmware <http://ethersex.de> via TCP/RS232.
This includes on the hardware side the commercial Pollin AVR-NET-IO, wich gave the project its name.
The software consists of a Python class to represent the possibilities of 
the product and example code to show how to use it.

Find more information on <http://pklaus.github.com/avrnetio>.

## Moving Forward

I hope that someone will join the team as I have no time yet to complete
the class. If you know Python and want to contribute, then please join the team!
