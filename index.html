<h1>Welcome to avrnetio</h1>
<p>
  This is a software project written in Python to make interaction with the ethersex platform really easy for you. You can use this project (and the Python classes it contains) as a basis for your data aquisition. This means you can measure voltages, set digital outputs &amp; much more. See <a href="http://ethersex.de">ethersex.de</a>I for details about the ethersex project and its capabilities. In contrast to what the project name avrnetio might suppose, you can interact with any ethersex hardware, not just the commercial Pollin AVR-NET-IO.
